README for Frequency

This program will take two inputs from a user separated by a comma. One is a single word and the other is a string of words. It will then look for how many times the word occurs in the string and return the result.

Root folder includes lib/frequency.rb and spec/frequency_spec.rb

Gems required: rspec
